# 👋 Hello there! I'm Sunit Shrestha

I'm a 3rd year Computer Engineering student at Pulchowk Campus with a deep love for **science, math, and technology** 🔬📐💻. Ever since I can remember, I've been the kind of person who *has to know how things work* — whether it's peeling back the layers of an ML model or understanding the universe through the lens of physics and math 🌌.

## 🚀 What Drives Me

I live for those *"aha!"* moments — when an abstract concept suddenly clicks or when a messy real-world problem finds a beautiful solution. My curiosity doesn't clock out. Whether it's solving tricky competitive programming problems, diving into a CTF challenge, reading research papers, or building stuff for fun — I'm always exploring 🔍📚.

## 🌟 Outside the Curriculum

Even when it's not part of the syllabus, you'll find me diving deep into relativity, reading about mathematical beauty, or tinkering with new tools. I believe **curiosity is the ultimate teacher** and that knowledge should be *explored*, not just *acquired* 🤓.
